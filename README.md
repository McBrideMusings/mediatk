# Media Toolkit

A python-based CLI tool for managing video files. Currently very WIP.

The primary reason I built this was a parinoia for fully-automated alternatives, a desire to customize the output to my preferences and difficulty in getting other solutions working with Linux Intel quicksync

Still pretty hard-coded to intel-specific HW acceleration but otherwise does work right now.
